**Netflix’s popular brain survival game show “The Devil’s Plan” is set to return for another season!**

On November 7, Netflix officially announced that “The Devil’s Plan” has been renewed for a second season.

Created by producing director (PD) Jung Jong Yeon of “*The Genius*” and “*The Great Escape*,” “*The Devil’s Plan*” is Netflix’s survival game show in which 12 players from diverse professions gather for a week-long camp, completely cut off from the outside world. They engage in intense competition and test their limits through mind-bending games and challenges to win the ultimate prize of 500 million won (approximately $381,560) and be crowned the ultimate brain.

Upon its premiere, “*The Devil’s Plan*” achieved first place in Netflix’s Top 10 Series in South Korea and took No. 1 in Good Data Corporation’s TV-OTT integrated non-drama that generated the most buzz. The show also made its mark in Netflix’s Top 10 rankings in 23 countries.
