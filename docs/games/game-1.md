# Game 1: Virus

![](./img/Game1.webp)

Players randomly selected a number dictating the order they would select a card from twelve laid out inside the dealer room. Each card had a role on it which the player would be.

**Terrorist** (tries to kill all citizens). Each terrorist has one bullet, which they can use to kill one player. Each terrorist also has one virus, which they can infect one player, and the virus spreads through the number order. Players infected with the virus after one round are killed. There are two terrorists.

**Fanatic** (tries to get killed by the terrorists or virus). Unlike popular social deduction games such as Among Us, there is no voting to eliminate players. Depending on how early the fanatic gets killed, they receive varying amounts of pieces, with a higher count the earlier they die. There is only one fanatic.

**Officer** (tries to kill the terrorists). The officer gets one bullet each round, and gets varying amounts of pieces depending on how successful they are. There is only one officer.
Ordinary Citizen (tries to eliminate the terrorists) is unable to do very much besides observe, as they have no special abilities. One of the ordinary citizens contains an antidote to the virus, without their knowing, that grants them immunity from the virus. There are five ordinary citizens.

**Researcher** (tries to develop antidote using the citizen with the antidote). The researchers do not know who carries it, and may choose one person each round. If they are successful, the development process continues for the cure. If they succeed, the citizens win the game. There are two researchers.

**Journalist** (tries to eliminate the terrorists). The journalist can investigate one player each round, and discover their identity. They can then relay the information to the officer (whose identity is hidden), who can then kill one of the terrorists. There is one journalist.
