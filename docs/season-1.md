# Synopsys

Twelve celebrity contestants are initially given one "Piece". A player with no Pieces is eliminated; Pieces can be traded between players or spent on in-game benefits. Pieces can be won and lost in the two daily matches: the Main Match and the Prize Match.

After the competitive Main Match, the two surviving players with the fewest Pieces are sent to prison until the next Main Match. The player or players with the most Pieces make tie-breaking decisions about who is sent to prison. The collaborative Prize Match determines whether a sum of money—₩50,000,000 or ₩100,000,000—is added to the final pot, which can total up to ₩500,000,000.

Games featured include social deduction games, board games, card games and abstract strategy games like nine men's morris. Main Matches typically see players forming alliances, while the Prize Matches test skills including memorization, numerical calculation and visualization.

Combining three different types of pieces forms an octahedron-like shape from which the clue "NEXT YEAR" can be read. Using this clue—by typing 2024 into a hidden safe in the prison—unlocks a special individual challenge - a variant of Gomoku in which the player must remember the colour of each piece, in which the player can win 10 Pieces but risk elimination from the game.
